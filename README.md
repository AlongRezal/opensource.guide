The X Rules
The X Rules
X's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.
 

Safety
Violent Speech: You may not threaten, incite, glorify, or express desire for violence or harm. Learn more.

Violent & Hateful Entities: You can’t affiliate with or promote the activities of violent and hateful entities. Learn more.

Child Sexual Exploitation: We have zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation on X. Learn more.

Abuse/Harassment: You may not share abusive content, engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. Learn more.

Hateful conduct: You may not attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Learn more. 

Perpetrators of Violent Attacks: We will remove any accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, and may also remove posts disseminating manifestos or other content produced by perpetrators. Learn more. 

Suicide: You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm. Learn more.

Sensitive media: You may not post media that is excessively gory or share violent or adult content within live video or in profile or header images. Media depicting sexual violence and/or assault is also not permitted. Learn more. 

Illegal or Certain Regulated Goods or Services: You may not use our service for any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities. This includes selling, buying, or facilitating transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services. Learn more.


Privacy
 

Private Information: You may not publish or post other people's private information (such as home phone number and address) without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so. Learn more.

Non-Consensual Nudity: You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent. Learn more.

Account Compromise: You may not use or attempt to use credentials, passwords, tokens, keys, cookies or other data to log into or otherwise access, add, delete or modify the private information or account features of any X account other than your own (or those you have been directly authorized to do so via X’s Teams authorization, OAuth authorization or similar mechanism). 


Authenticity

Platform Manipulation and Spam: You may not use X’s services in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on X. Learn more.

Civic Integrity: You may not use X’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. Learn more.

Misleading and Deceptive Identities: You may not impersonate individuals, groups, or organizations to mislead, confuse, or deceive others, nor use a fake identity in a manner that disrupts the experience of others on X. Learn more.

Synthetic and Manipulated Media: You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, we may label posts containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context. Learn more.

Open Source Guides (https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.

## Background
Open Source Guides were created and are curated by GitHub, along with input from outside community reviewers, but they are not exclusive to GitHub products. One reason we started this project is because we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open source projects.

Our goal is to aggregate community best practices, *not* what GitHub (or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we try to use examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.

## Contributing

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Check out our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to offer feedback and contribute.

## Licenses

Content is released under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See [notices](notices.md) for complete details, including attribution guidelines, contribution terms, and software and third-party licenses and permissions.

## Acknowledgments

The initial release of these guides were authored by **[@nayafia][1], [@bkeepers][2], [@stephbwills][3],** and **[@mlinksva][4]**.

Thanks to **[@aitchabee][5], [@benbalter][6], [@brettcannon][7], [@caabernathy][8], [@coralineada][9], [@dmleong][10], [@ericholscher][11], [@gr2m][12], [@janl][13], [@jessfraz][14], [@joshsimmons][15], [@kfogel][16], [@kytrinyx][17], [@lee-dohm][18], [@mikeal][19], [@mikemcquaid][20], [@nathansobo][21], [@nruff][22], [@nsqe][23], [@orta][24], [@parkr][25], [@shazow][26], [@steveklabnik][27],** and **[@wooorm][28]** for lending their valuable input and expertise leading up to the initial release, and to **[@sophshep][29]** and **[@jeejkang][30]** for designing and illustrating the guides.
